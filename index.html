	<p>I work in recruiting, which means that I interact with a lot of people, especially candidates on a daily basis and most of these interactions happen over e-mail or digitally. Here is an overview of my names, on post-its attached to my laptop, as a prank from my colleagues for birthday. Just scroll over the image ;) </p><br>

	<p>Further there is a list of my names misspelled <br>
		<ol>
			<li><p><strong>"Mirella"</strong>: ok, this is the obvious one and it happens mainly because of the autocorrect. <br>
				Fact: in all the other latin language besides Romanian, my name is spelled "Mirella." <br>
				Fun fact: I found in my inbox 88 e-mails in which my name was spelled "Mirella"</li>
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Mirella_pictures/mirella1.png" alt="mirella1" width="200" height="100">
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Mirella_pictures/mirella2.png" alt="mirella2" width="200" height="100">
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Mirella_pictures/mirella3.png" alt="mirella3" width="300" height="100">
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Mirella_pictures/mirella4.png" alt="mirella4" width="200" height="100">
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Mirella_pictures/mirella5.png" alt="mirella5" width="250" height="100">
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Mirella_pictures/mirella6.png" alt="mirella6" width="300" height="100"></p><br>
			<li><p><strong>"Estefan"</strong>: this one is from a customer service representative, when I had a question about one of my travel bookings</li>
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Different_names_pictures/estefan.png" alt="estefan" width="200" height="100"></p><br>
			<li><p><strong>"Milena"</strong>: this one is from a calendar invite and I want to assume it was autocorrect</li>
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Different_names_pictures/milena2.png" alt="milena" width="300" height="50"></p><br>
			<li><p><strong>"mineral"</strong>: this was for sure autocorrect. It was done by one of my colleagues, who found hilarious how autocorrect changed my name and share it with me</li>
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Different_names_pictures/mineral.png" alt="mineral" width="700" height="50"></p><br>
			<li><p><strong>"Morela"</strong>: this is from when I contacted the customer support through live chat from one of our tools</li>
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Different_names_pictures/morela.png" alt="morela" width="500" height="100"></p><br>
			<li><p><strong>"Stefanovic"</strong>: just one of the e-mails I got from someone. Fact: "Sehr geehrte Frau" translates to "Dear Miss"</li>
				<img src="file:///D:/My_website_programming/Different_names_pictures/stefanovic.png" alt="Stefanovic" width="300" height="50"></p><br>
			<li><p><strong>"Thomas"</strong>: this is one of my favourites. One of my stakeholders had to fill in a form where my name was required. I have no idea how you can get from "Mirela Stefan" to "Mirela Thomas", but it was way too funny. My assuption is that this person wanted to copy-paste my name, but he pasted the wrong one</li>
